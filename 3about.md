 <p> <font size="5"> <b>Design </b> </font> </p>

<p>
My name is Nicolò Merendino andI work as a UX/UI designer under the pseudonym "Chi ha Ucciso il Conte?" My work primarily focuses on <b>creating interfaces for electronic music and multimedia arts </b>, collaborating with artists to design and build custom instruments that support their creative practices. <br>I specialize in both <b>designing and constructing</b> electronic devices as well as developing graphical user interfaces tailored to specific needs.
I am specialized in the use of <b>Free/Libre Open Source Software</b>
<br><br>
With a strong background in <b>digital fabrication</b>, I operate my own fabrication lab and have previously served as a lab manager in FabLabs, overseeing a range of projects.

<p> <font size="5"> <b>Research </b> </font> </p>

<p>
In recent years, I’ve expanded my work into <b>academic research</b>, applying my design and fabrication skills to explore new areas of inquiry, you can find more details in the <a href="https://chihauccisoilconte.eu/2research.html" target="_blank"> dedicated page</a> . 
</p>
<p>
I am currently affiliated with the <a href="https://csc.dei.unipd.it/" target="_blank">Center for Computational Sonology</a>  at the University of Padova (Italy).
</p>

<p>
My recent research effort has primarily explored <b>critical reflection and sustainable action within design practices</b>. I have investigated open-source tools and methods to develop interfaces in both the form of tangible devices and GUIs . The aim of these explorations is to push the boundaries of current practices, finding solutions to enhance the full potential of each design project, while <b>considering its long-term impact</b>.

 <p> <font size="5"> <b>Teaching </b> </font> </p>



<p>
In addition to my work as a designer and my university teaching as part of my research, I have been organizing courses and workshops for nearly a decade in FabLabs, makerspaces, and various other institutions. These sessions primarily focus on introducing and working with FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) CAD tools, helping participants develop valuable skills in open-source design and digital fabrication.

<p>
Over the past several years, I have taught classes in various settings, both as a freelance professional and as a FabLab/Makerspace Manager. Some of the key institutions where I have organized and led workshops include ZB45 (Amsterdam, NL), the Instrument Inventors Initiative (The Hague, NL), SoundMit (Turin, Italy), and Waag Society (Amsterdam, NL), among others.<br><br>

<p>
Years of freelance work and academia in Italy turned me into an evil super villain, named <a href="https://chihauccisoilconte.eu/7barondeathwavebarberini.html" target="_blank">Baron Deathwave Barberini</a> .
