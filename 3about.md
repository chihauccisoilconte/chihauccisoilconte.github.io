My name is Nicolò Merendino andI work as a UX/UI designer under the pseudonym "Chi ha Ucciso il Conte?" My work primarily focuses on <b>creating interfaces for electronic music and multimedia arts </b>, collaborating with artists to design and build custom instruments that support their creative practices. I specialize in both designing and constructing electronic devices as well as developing graphical user interfaces tailored to specific needs.
I am specialized in the use of <b>Free/Libre Open Source Software</b>.
<br><br>
With a strong background in <b>digital fabrication</b>, I operate my own fabrication lab and have previously served as a lab manager in FabLabs, overseeing a range of projects.

 <p> <font size="5"> <b>Teaching </b> </font> </p>



<p>
In addition to my work as a designer and my university teaching as part of my research, I have been organizing courses and workshops for nearly a decade in FabLabs, makerspaces, and various other institutions. These sessions primarily focus on introducing and working with FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) CAD tools, helping participants develop valuable skills in open-source design and digital fabrication.
