<p>
Chi Ha Ucciso il Conte? is a pseudonym for a Parma (Italy) based UX/UI Designer

</p>

<p>
I am a <b> Designer</b>, <b>researcher</b> and practitioner in <b>digital fabrication</b> and <b>interaction design</b>. I engage in hands-on design projects and studies with people and communities, and I have over a decade of experience in supporting artists and musicians to develop new interactive devices with a focus on new musical experiences. My recent research effort has primarily explored critical reflection and sustainable action within design practices. I have investigated open-source tools and methods to <b>develop interfaces in both the form of tangible devices and GUIs </b>. The aim of these explorations is to push the boundaries of current practices, finding innovative solutions to enhance the full potential of each design project, while considering its long-term impact. <br>
