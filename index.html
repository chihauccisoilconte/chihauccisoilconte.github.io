<h1> Welcome!</h1>

<p>
This is <b> "Chi ha ucciso il Conte?"</b>'s website.
</p>

<p>
“Chi Ha Ucciso il Conte?” is a pseudonym for the Venice based designer Nicolò Merendino.
It is not a random fact that “Chi Ha Ucciso Il Conte?” is a question and not a statement.
My approach to design starts from the idea that design is a process that requires people to ask to themselves many questions.

“Chi Ha Ucciso il Conte?” is specialized in developing the Design of <b>electronic music instruments</b> and <b>components for media art installations</b>.
