Alongside my work as a designer, I also engage in <b>academic research</b> and <b>teaching</b> across various contexts.
</p>







 <p> <font size="6"> <b>Research </b> </font> </p>

<p>

In recent years, I have broadened my practice to encompass academic research. I am currently affiliated with the <a href="https://csc.dei.unipd.it/" target="_blank">Center for Computational Sonology</a>  at the University of Padova (Italy).
</p>
<p>
My research primarily revolves around the intersection of <b> design practices, human-computer interaction, and music technology</b>. I focus on exploring innovative ways to enhance how we interact with digital musical instruments and technology. A key aspect of my work involves fostering critical and sustainable reflections on these topics, aiming to push the boundaries of what is possible while considering their long-term impact on society and the environment.
</p>
<p>
In addition to theoretical exploration, <b>I actively engage in hands-on design case studies with individuals and communities</b>. This collaborative approach allows me to test and refine ideas in real-world contexts, ensuring that my research not only advances the field but also remains grounded in the needs and experiences of users and designers.

<p>
In addition to my work teaching at universities, I have been organizing courses and workshops for nearly a decade in FabLabs, maker spaces, and various other institutions. These sessions primarily focus on introducing and working with FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) CAD tools, helping participants gain valuable skills in open-source design and digital fabrication.

<p>
Over the past several years, I have taught classes in a variety of settings as both a freelance professional and a FabLab/Makerspac Manager. Some of the key institutions where I’ve organised and led workshops include:
</p>



ZB45 (Amsterdam, NL) <br>
FablabWag (Wageningen, NL) <br>
FablabGroningen (Groningen, NL) <br>
STEIM (Amsterdam, NL)<br>
Roma Makers (Rome, Italy)<br>
Waag Society (Amsterdam, NL)<br>
Fab13 (Tilburg, NL)<br>
CrunchLab (Venice, Italy)<br>
Fablab Parma (Italy)<br>
SoundMit (Turin, Italy)<br>
Instrument Inventors Initiative (Den Haag, NL)

<p>
In addition to in-person teaching, I have created several  <a href="https://vimeo.com/album/4661933" target="_blank">video tutorials </a>  to promote and expand the use of FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) in creative and technical fields.

<p>
My teaching activities have been supported by various grants, including funding from <a href="https://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/" target="_blank"> The Creative Industries Fund of the Netherlands </a>  and <a href="https://stimuleringsfonds.nl/en/" target="_blank"> Google’s Digital News Innovation Fund. </a>
