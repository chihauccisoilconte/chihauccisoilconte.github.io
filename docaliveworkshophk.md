<b>DocAlive Workshop: Reflecting on Documentation, Archiving and Re-activation Practices in Multimedia Arts</b>
 
</p>

<p>
This workshop, hosted at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), brings together scholars, designers, and creative practitioners to explore how documentation practices shape the development, circulation, and impact of multimedia design projects. As creative outputs increasingly integrate interactive media, computational systems, and cross-disciplinary methods, the act of documenting work has become essential—not only for archiving processes and outcomes, but also for enabling critical reflection, collaboration, and future research.

Their contributions will highlight diverse strategies for capturing creative processes, from technical documentation to narrative-driven formats. Besides the invited speakers and the faculty involved, the workshop will also include an open call through which interested scholars and practitioners can apply to take part in the activities.
